# Sumrise
Link summarizer and indexer - CapitalOne Tech Summit 2016
---
So I come across a lot of articles that interest me on a daily basis. I really don't have a way of saving/indexing them, so I created this application to solve that problem. This app is a link sumamrizer and indexer: When you find an article you like you can save it to your own private journal, along with a summarized version of the articles contents for easy viewing later on. 

This is full application, with user authenticaiton and http requests to a server I created to handle the needs of someone using this app. There were plans for an Android Client to view your summaries, but because of finals I don't know if that'll happen haha.

Technologies:
1. Server - Node.js and Express
2. Chrome Extension - HTML, CSS, and JS
3. Android Client - Java
