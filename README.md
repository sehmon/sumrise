# Sumrise
Link summarizer and indexer - CapitalOne Tech Summit 2016
---
So I come across a lot of articles that interest me on a daily basis. I really don't have a way of saving/indexing them, so I created this application to solve that problem. This app is a link sumamrizer and indexer: When you find an article you like you can save it to your own private journal, along with a summarized version of the articles contents for easy viewing later on. 

I was really interested in learning Node.js and Express/React/Angular, so I decided to create the backend API with Javascript. All the API headers are working.

This is full application, with user authenticaiton and http requests to a server I created to handle the needs of someone using this app. There were plans for an Chrome Extension Android Client to view your summaries, but because of finals I don't know if that'll happen haha.

###Technologies:
1. Server - Node.js and Express <br>
2. Chrome Extension - HTML, CSS, and JS <br>
3. Android Client - Java <br>

The only part that is working right now is sumrise-api. Here's how to run it:
